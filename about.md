I am an Environmental and Indigenous Community Planner and Project Manager. I have worked with a range of clients across the country (resource developers, various levels of government, and associated agencies) but my main focus has been in working with Indigenous communities in the areas of: 

- Environmental / impact assessments (provincial and federal), studies and reviews, including 
 Indigenous rights and interests
- Traditional (Indigenous) knowledge and land use data collection, including approaches to integration 
 with western science and into planning processes
- Environmental management and associated planning including development of community 
 Environmental Management Plans and liability risk management
- Policy development and processes to implement new legislation
- Consultation, engagement and facilitation
- Capacity building at the community level
- Supporting comprehensive community planning, and land use and economic development planning 
 processes

I also work with many First Nation communities operating under a Land Code (or preparing to) and am versed in the implications on governance and land management.

Much of my work involves bringing together various types of knowledge and information for decision making processes, and developing tailored strategies to facilitate meaningful engagement and achieve desired knowledge sharing outcomes.

About me personally: I love to travel, and talk to new people, to hear their stories. Before my consulting career (between my degrees), I worked in the hospitality sector because it allowed me to travel to some pretty amazing parts of the world. I worked in restaurants in Lake Louise and Banff. I bartended in Vietnam. I explored Southeast Asia. I was the Cruise Director of a luxury cruise in Australia, and then lived in a van and traveled around the country, exploring most of the protected areas. 

This is where I first learned about how Indigenous Knowledge could be used to inform land management and use. This was a game changer for me. In my education, I was steeped in the sciences. But then as I traveled, I slowly learned about local and Indigenous knowledge and their importance alongside "western" science. This led me to return to Canada to do my master's research, which then took me to Nepal where I explored the different knowledge types used to manage the Annapurna Conservation Area and tourism within it. I can truly say that my travels provided me with an education that traditional schooling did not. And they led me on my current career path, which I love.
